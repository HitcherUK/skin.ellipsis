	<description  lang="en">Ellipsis is a Graphical User Interface for XBMC Media Center. Our aim with Ellipsis is to make the navigation and use of XBMC as user friendly as possible, so easy to use infact that a young child can use it just as easily as her grandmother can. Hopefully we have achieved this goal. Supporting the latest media center additions, such as full library support, fanart and media flags, We think you will enjoy what Ellipsis has to offer.</description>
